abstract  ="Delocalization insights into inorganic lead halide perovskites of the form CsPbBrxI3−x (x = 0{,} 1{,} 2{,} 3){,} obtained via a DFT based tight-binding method{,} are presented. Compared to first principles studies like DFT (physically accurate and computationally expensive){,} the tight-binding approach allows the disentanglement of the region of interest{,} namely{,} the Fermi level. Further adjustment of the hopping norm and maximum distance leads to a simplified{,} highly interpretable but chemically grounded{,} reduced model which regenerates the broad features of the band structure with a fraction of the parameters. We observe that due to the delocalized nature of its orbitals{,} CsPbBrI2 follows a many-small hopping scheme{,} markedly different in character from the few-big strategy taken by the other members of the set. Finally we leverage the tight-binding model to study the electronic and thermal transport properties of these materials. These insights enable the identification of optimal doping strategies that could enhance the thermoelectric performance of these materials."}

abstract = {Electrochemical energy storage devices run on two fundamentally different processes: charge storage across the double layer and redox reactions. A satisfactory understanding of the underlying mechanism is only possible once the two contributions are deconvoluted. The b-value and the ν −ν1/2 model are two familiar steps undertaken to separate these contributions but as it is shown here both metrics are flawed, prone to misinterpretation, frequently invoked without attention to their limitations, and in need of re-examination. After exploring these flaws through the lens of a diverse set of cyclic voltammetry data we opine that use of the b-value be discouraged on account of subjectivity inherent to the metric, and the ν −ν1/2 model be replaced by the one proposed here. This new model ultimately reduces the root mean square error significantly and provides a robust tool for the evaluation of energy storage devices.},

abstract = {Summary Alkaline earth and transition metal sulfides have been recognized as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage on account of their reversibility, electroconductivity, and rate capability. In this work, we explore the energy storage profile of a strontium sulfide, SrS, electrode developed via the sonochemical method providing a capacity of 451 C/g. We then sift out its capacitive and diffusive contributions using Dunn's model and extend the analysis by examining the correlation between the regression parameters k1 and k2 of the model in greater detail to bring to light electrochemical features that are obscured by the currently prevailing methods of presenting data for cyclic voltammetry experiments. This method presented here may be generalized to other electrode materials to unveil hidden processes in various electrochemical energy storage systems.},
