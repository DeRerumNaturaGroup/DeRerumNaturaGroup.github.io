Whether by your own free will or through some immutable chain of events (or both, see ['Compatibilism'](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)), you have arrived on the website of the Computational Materials Group at GIK Institute.

If this is a mistake you can rectify it immediately. Though if you ask us, we think that in the words of T.S. Eliot:

<blockquote>"This is your real destination."</blockquote>

 So stay here and take a look. 

 But please note that the website is still under development. Apart from an overview of the group's activities, other resources related to the group will also be posted here.

<!-- <blockquote>
If you came this way,\
Taking any route, starting from anywhere,\
At any time or at any season,\
It would always be the same: you would have to put off\
Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,\
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity\
Or carry report. You are here to kneel\
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more\
Than an order of words, <s>the conscious occupation</s>\
Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.\
