    "text": "Background\n\nThe Tight-Binding Hamiltonian\nThe tight-binding method is a simple but powerful way to describe how electrons move in a solid. The core idea is that electrons tend to stay close to the atoms they belong to, but they can also spread out by “hopping” to neighboring atoms. This balance between staying localized and moving through the material, determines many of the electronic properties of a crystal.\nBy focusing only on the energy of an electron on an atom and the probability of hopping between nearby atoms, the tight-binding model captures the essential physics behind band formation, electrical conductivity, and the electronic structure of a wide range of materials. Despite its simplicity, it often provides accurate insights into systems ranging from common solids to advanced materials like graphene, semiconductors, and topological phases.\n\n\nAnion-Exchance and ILHPs\nIonic liquid–hybrid perovskites (ILHPs) integrate ionic liquids into the perovskite lattice, enhancing stability, ion mobility, and defect behavior. Combined with anion exchange, which replaces halide ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) in the structure, these materials allow precise tuning of optical and electronic properties without altering the overall lattice.\nTogether, ILHPs and anion exchange provide a versatile platform for designing perovskites with tailored stability, bandgaps, and performance for applications in solar cells, LEDs, and other optoelectronic devices."

Closer examination allows us to extract from this, reduced TB (redTB) models which are readily interpretable. The hopping distribution abstracted from the redTB model singles out CsPbBrI\\(_2\\) as being qualitatively and quantitatively different from the rest of the set, following a many-small as opposed to the few-big hopping scheme employed by the others."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you open the header of an espresso pw.x output file, you might see:\n     number of electrons       =        44.00\n     number of Kohn-Sham states=           26\nWell, what are these?\nIn understanding electronic structure calculations using density functional theory (DFT), it’s useful to imagine a familiar situation: a family going on a picnic.\n\n\n\nThe number of KS States is like the rows of seats on a bus and the number of electrons are akin to the people riding out to picnic.\n\n\nThe number of valence electrons in a material is like the number of family members who are actually going on the picnic. These are the people who will participate in activities, contribute to the experience, and need to be accounted for in the logistics. Similarly, valence electrons are those that participate in bonding and electronic behavior, and are the focus of most DFT calculations.\nHowever, in organizing a real trip, one often brings more than just the family. There may be a hired guide to navigate, porters to carry supplies, or someone skilled in negotiation for dealing with vendors. This expanded group represents the total number of electrons in a DFT calculation. It includes both the valence electrons and any additional electrons that the pseudopotential has chosen to treat explicitly—perhaps semicore states or shallow core levels that are important for accuracy in certain elements.\nTo transport this group, a bus is needed. The Kohn–Sham states correspond to the rows of seats on the bus. In a non-spin-polarized system, each row can seat two people: one with spin up and one with spin down. Therefore, the number of rows ideally needs to be at least half the number of electrons. But planning conservatively, we often include more rows than necessary—not everyone likes to share a seat, and we may want to observe what other passengers (electronic states) are doing even if they are not part of the initial group. These extra rows represent the unoccupied Kohn–Sham states, which are important for understanding conduction bands, optical transitions, and other excited-state properties.\nThis analogy helps clarify why the number of Kohn–Sham states is not the same as the number of electrons, and why pseudopotentials and spin considerations affect how many orbitals the DFT calculation must solve for.\nWhile the picnic bus analogy helps build intuition about valence electrons, total electrons, and Kohn–Sham states in DFT, it necessarily simplifies a number of important physical and computational subtleties and its limitations must always be at the back of our mind:\n\nFirst, the analogy treats Kohn–Sham states as fixed seats, suggesting a discrete, localized picture. In reality, Kohn–Sham orbitals are continuous wavefunctions—often delocalized over an entire crystal in the form of Bloch states. They are not static slots that electrons occupy, but mathematical solutions to a differential equation that describe how electron density is distributed in space.\nSecond, the analogy implies that electrons either fully occupy or do not occupy Kohn–Sham states, like passengers sitting in seats. This works for insulators and simple semiconductors, but breaks down in metals or finite-temperature systems where fractional occupations are common. In such cases, the occupancy of a state is not binary, but smoothly distributed around the Fermi level according to the Fermi–Dirac distribution.\nThird, unoccupied Kohn–Sham states are portrayed as empty rows included just in case they’re needed. However, these states are not merely optional extras—they are integral to predicting important physical properties, such as optical absorption spectra, band gaps, and excited-state behavior. They must be computed carefully and with the same rigor as occupied states.\nFourth, the treatment of spin in the analogy is simplified. While saying that “some people prefer not to share a row” illustrates the difference between spin-polarized and non-spin-polarized calculations, it glosses over more subtle aspects of spin, such as antiferromagnetic ordering, spin splitting, and spin–orbit coupling. These effects can lead to highly nontrivial behavior in the electronic structure, which cannot be captured by the seating metaphor.\nFinally, while the role of the pseudopotential is likened to choosing who goes on the trip, the analogy omits the fact that pseudopotentials also encode how valence electrons interact with the frozen core. This interaction affects transferability, scattering properties, and the accuracy of calculated forces—factors that are invisible in the analogy."

However, it is to keep in mind that higher energy cutoff increases the computational cost. Mostly pseudopotential files provide the estimated energy cutoff but it is still recommended to perform convergence test. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials suggest low energy cutoff while it is larger for norm conserving pseudopotentials.\nk-mesh convergence can be performed by changing the k points in the input file of QE.

We explore matter and its methods, through the lens of simulations and data. Our work lies at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and data science—leveraging first-principles simulations, high-throughput workflows, and machine learning to advance materials discovery. Rooted in open science and guided by curiosity, we build tools, datasets, and models that make this understanding widely accessible.\n\nThe website is still under-development and new information will be added soon.",

But like any material, they are not perfect—tiny imperfections, or defects, naturally appear in their crystal structure. The presence of transition metals adds another layer of complexity, as their multiple oxidation states and strong interactions with the lattice can create additional defect states or alter defect behavior. Some defects can improve performance, enhancing how electrons move or how light is absorbed, while others act as traps that reduce efficiency and stability. By studying these defects i.e. how they form, migrate, and interact, we can better understand perovskites and design materials that are more efficient, longer-lasting, and tailored for specific applications."
