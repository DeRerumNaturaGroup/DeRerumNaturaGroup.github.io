    "text": "Calculations\nSCF calculations give the total energy of the system to obtain the ground state properties of material. But prior to scf calculations, relaxation calculation is necessary to remove the strains on the system and optimize the atomic positions as well as unit cell. QE uses BFGS algorithm (Do i need to explain BFGS theorem?) to optimize the atomic positions through relax and cell parameters through vc-relax calculation. It is itterative process similar to scf calculations where BFGS algorithm obtain the values of atomic positions and then energy is calculated through SCF calculation and forces are calculated using Hellmann‐Feynman theorem. The cycle stops when the energy and forces values achieve convergence criteris provided in the input file.

For this purpose, perform multiple scf calculations for different values.\nThe energy cutoff determines how many plane waves are to be used for calculations which is directly related to the accuracy of results. However, it is to keep in mind that higher energy cutoff increases the computational cost. Mostly pseudopotential files provide the estimated energy cutoff but it is still recommended to perform convergence test. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials suggest low energy cutoff while it is larger for norm conserving pseudopotentials.\nk-mesh convergence can be performed by changing the k points in the input file of QE.
